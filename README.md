# VGG-16 Implementation In Tensorflow   
### Introduction.
  I wrote this code when I was learning different deep learning frameworks. VGG is state of the art deep learning model used in computer vision for object classification and feature extraction. 

### Requirements.
I tested this code on ubuntu 16, you have to install tensorflow and tensorboard on your python environment.
''' 
pip install tensorflow==1.15
